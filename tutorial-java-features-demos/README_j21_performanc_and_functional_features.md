Hereâ€™s a list of Java 21 features that can directly improve performance and functionality in the UniCredit Investment Proposal Management System (UC project)â€”especially across microservices like Proposal, Audit, Notification, etc.


---

ðŸš€ Performance Improvements

1. Virtual Threads (Finalized)

Use Case: Proposal, Audit, and Notification services can use virtual threads to handle thousands of Kafka events concurrently without blocking traditional OS threads.

Benefit: Reduces thread overhead â†’ improved throughput and resource utilization.

Example:

Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> kafkaConsumer.pollAndProcess());



---

2. Scoped Values (Preview)

Use Case: Replace ThreadLocal in async logging or tracing within microservices.

Benefit: Thread-safe, efficient context propagation without memory leaks.

Example:

ScopedValue<String> TRACE_ID = ScopedValue.newInstance();
ScopedValue.where(TRACE_ID, "txn-1234").run(() -> logService.logTrace());



---

ðŸ§  Functionality & Maintainability

3. Pattern Matching for switch (Finalized)

Use Case: Route ProposalEvent to different handlers like Audit, Notification.

Benefit: Clean and extensible code; supports new event types with minimal changes.

Example:

return switch (event) {
    case ProposalSubmitted p -> "submit-handler";
    case ProposalApproved p -> "approval-handler";
    default -> "unknown";
};



---

4. Record Patterns (Finalized)

Use Case: Simplify parsing DTOs like ProposalRecord from Kafka.

Benefit: Cleaner extraction logic without boilerplate.

Example:

if (obj instanceof ProposalRecord(String id, BigDecimal amount)) {
    auditService.log(id, amount);
}



---

5. Sealed Classes / Interfaces (Finalized)

Use Case: Model the event hierarchy: ProposalEvent â†’ Submitted, Approved, Rejected.

Benefit: Compile-time safety; prevents unauthorized extension.

Example:

public sealed interface ProposalEvent permits Submitted, Approved, Rejected {}



---

6. String Templates (Preview)

Use Case: Format notifications, audit logs, or emails.

Benefit: Avoid String.format(); readable and secure templating.

Example:

STR."Proposal \(id) submitted by \(user) for \(amount) EUR"



---

ðŸ”’ Security & Robustness

7. Unnamed Variables & Patterns

Use Case: Simplify pattern matching when not all values are needed.

Benefit: Cleaner code, no unnecessary variable declarations.

Example:

switch (event) {
  case ProposalSubmitted(_, BigDecimal amount) -> handleAmount(amount);
}

Would you like me to show how to convert an existing UC service class to use these Java 21 features (e.g., EventRouter, AuditConsumer, etc.)?
