Got it! Here’s a crisp map of **“latest Java features” grouped by application category**, with quick UC (Investment Proposal) examples and what version they land in.

---

# Web / REST Microservices (productivity & clarity)

* **Records** (Java 16+, heavily used on 21): immutable DTOs/events → fewer bugs, less boilerplate.
  *Use for:* request/response bodies, Kafka events.
  *Example:* `record ProposalEvent(String id, ProposalEventType type, long proposalId, Map<String,Object> payload, OffsetDateTime at){}` (works great with Spring/Jackson).
  *Refs:* JDK 21 list includes record-friendly features like record patterns. ([OpenJDK][1])
* **Pattern Matching for `switch`** (final in Java 21): route logic by enum/type with exhaustive cases.
  *Use for:* event routers, validators. ([OpenJDK][1])
* **Record Patterns** (Java 21): destructure records directly in `switch`/`instanceof`.
  *Use for:* concise consumers parsing events. ([OpenJDK][1])
* **Unnamed Patterns/Variables** (preview in 21, permanent in 22): ignore parts you don’t need (`_`).
  *Use for:* tidy controllers/routers. ([OpenJDK][1])
* **Sequenced Collections** (Java 21): `first()/last()/addFirst()/addLast()` on lists/sets/maps.
  *Use for:* approval chains where order matters. ([OpenJDK][1])

# Concurrency & Resilience (high-throughput services)

* **Virtual Threads** (Java 21): cheap threads → scale blocking IO (DB, HTTP, Kafka) without reactive plumbing.
  *Use for:* parallel risk/compliance calls during submission. ([OpenJDK][1])
* **Structured Concurrency** (preview in 21; second preview in 22): start related tasks as a unit; cancel siblings on failure.
  *Use for:* run “risk + AML + KYC” together with timeouts. ([OpenJDK][1])
* **Scoped Values** (preview in 21; evolved later): thread-safe context (better than ThreadLocal), works with virtual threads.
  *Use for:* propagate correlation-id across service layers & Kafka publisher. ([OpenJDK][1], [Oracle Documentation][2])

# Data / Streaming (pipelines, consumers, analytics helpers)

* **Stream Gatherers** (preview in Java 22): custom downstream operations for streams.
  *Use for:* streaming aggregations over audit entries. ([OpenJDK][3])
* **Vector API** (incubator ongoing: 21 sixth, 22 seventh): SIMD speedups for numeric workloads.
  *Use for:* quant/risk math hotspots (if any). ([OpenJDK][1])

---

# Interop / Systems (native, high-performance integrations)

* **Foreign Function & Memory API** (final in Java 22; was preview in 21): call C libraries & manage off-heap memory safely.
  *Use for:* native HSMs, low-latency market data libs, or CSV/Parquet readers without JNI pain. ([OpenJDK][3])

---

# Security / Compliance (finance-grade)

* **KEM (Key Encapsulation Mechanism) API** (Java 21): modern crypto primitive, stepping stone to HPKE/PQC.
  *Use for:* exchanging symmetric keys between services or with third-party gateways. ([OpenJDK][4], [seanjmullan.org][5])

---

# Performance / GC (low latency)

* **Generational ZGC** (Java 21): ZGC with generational collection for better throughput/latency.
  *Use for:* steady low pause times under event bursts. ([OpenJDK][1])

---

# DevX / Tooling & Launch

* **Launch Multi-File Source Programs** (Java 22): run multi-file apps without a build step.
  *Use for:* quick POCs/demos. ([OpenJDK][3])
* **Unnamed Classes & Instance `main`** (preview in Java 21): simpler scratch programs. ([OpenJDK][1])
* **Statements before `super(...)`** (preview in Java 22): prep logic before calling super-ctor in subclass.
  *Use for:* builder/factory patterns that need checks first. ([OpenJDK][3])

---

# Important status notes (so you don’t get tripped up)

* **String Templates**: *preview* in 21 & 22, **withdrawn from JDK 23** pending redesign—don’t rely on it in production. ([OpenJDK][1], [nipafx // You. Me. Java.][6], [Stack Overflow][7])
* **Scoped Values / Structured Concurrency**: previewed in 21, iterated in 22; keep an eye on their latest status as you choose to enable `--enable-preview`. ([OpenJDK][3])

## Quick UC mapping (what to adopt first)

1. **Records + switch/record patterns** → DTOs/events & consumers (clean, safe). ([OpenJDK][1])
2. **Virtual Threads** → DB & HTTP calls in Proposal Service (scale without complexity). ([OpenJDK][1])
3. **Sequenced Collections** → approval chain management. ([OpenJDK][1])
4. **Generational ZGC** → low-pause services under Kafka load. ([OpenJDK][1])
5. **(Optional, preview)** Structured Concurrency + Scoped Values → robust parallel checks + correlation-id propagation. ([OpenJDK][3])

If you want, I can generate **mini code snippets** for each category directly in your UC modules (proposal/audit/notification) so you can paste-and-run.
