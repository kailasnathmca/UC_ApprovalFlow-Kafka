Got you. Here’s a super clear, **audio-friendly script + step-by-step** you can *say out loud* to explain and also test the flow end-to-end.

---

# 1) 60-second story (say this in interviews)

“UC has three services. The client calls the **Proposal Service** over REST to create/submit/approve a proposal. The Proposal Service writes the DB \*\*and publishes a **`ProposalEvent`** to Kafka topic **`proposal-events`**, keyed by **proposalId** so events for the same proposal stay ordered. Kafka then **fans out** that event to multiple **consumer groups**: the **Audit Service** stores an audit trail, and the **Notification Service** sends or prints notifications. Each consumer is independent—if one is down, the other still works. Failures retry; persistent failures go to a **Dead-Letter Topic** so we can inspect and replay later.”

---

# 2) Tiny diagram (keep it simple)

```
Client → Proposal Service → (publish ProposalEvent) → Kafka topic: proposal-events
                                                   ↙                      ↘
                                          Audit Service               Notification Service
                                          (store audit)               (send/print notice)
```

---

# 3) What happens on each API call (step-by-step)

## A) Create a proposal (HTTP → DB)

1. Client calls `POST /api/proposals` with JSON.
2. Proposal Service validates & **saves** proposal in its DB (status = DRAFT).
3. (Usually no Kafka event yet—optional “CREATED” event if you added it.)

## B) Submit the proposal (HTTP → DB → Kafka)

1. Client calls `POST /api/proposals/{id}/submit`.
2. Proposal Service moves status to **UNDER\_REVIEW** in DB.
3. It builds a **`ProposalEvent`** like:

   ```json
   {
     "id": "uuid-1",
     "type": "PROPOSAL_SUBMITTED",
     "proposalId": 101,
     "payload": { "chain": ["PEER_REVIEW","MANAGER_APPROVAL","COMPLIANCE"] },
     "at": "2025-08-17T00:00:00Z"
   }
   ```
4. It **publishes** to Kafka topic **`proposal-events`** with **key="101"**.

### Downstream fan-out

* **Audit Service (@KafkaListener)** receives the event and **inserts an audit row** like “SUBMITTED by Alice”.
* **Notification Service (@KafkaListener)** receives the same event and **sends/prints a notification**.

## C) Approve a step (HTTP → DB → Kafka)

1. Client calls `POST /api/proposals/{id}/approve`.
2. Proposal Service updates DB (e.g., current\_step\_index++).
3. Publishes `STEP_APPROVED` with key = proposalId.
4. Audit adds “STEP\_APPROVED: MANAGER”; Notification informs the applicant.

## D) Final outcome (approve/reject)

* `PROPOSAL_APPROVED` or `PROPOSAL_REJECTED` is published.
* Audit closes the trail; Notification sends the final message.

---

# 4) Audio “definition bites” (use these phrases)

* **Topic**: “a named stream; we use `proposal-events`.”
* **Key**: “we key by `proposalId` so **ordering per proposal** is guaranteed.”
* **Consumer group**: “a named set of consumers; **one copy per group** gets each event.”
* **Fan-out**: “same event goes to **multiple groups**—Audit and Notification.”
* **DLT**: “poison events after retries go to `<topic>.DLT` for inspection & replay.”

---

# 5) Drive it yourself (quick commands + what you’ll see)

> Start services (from IDE) and Kafka. Ensure UI/CLI can see topic `proposal-events`.

### Create

```bash
curl -X POST :8081/api/proposals \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"IPO Fund","applicantName":"Riya","amount":150000,"description":"New fund"}'
```

**Expect:** DB row in proposal-service. (Usually no event yet.)

### Submit

```bash
curl -X POST :8081/api/proposals/1/submit
```

**Expect:**

* **Proposal Service logs**: “published PROPOSAL\_SUBMITTED for proposal 1 partition P offset O”
* **Audit Service logs**: “create-audit-row for proposal 1”
* **Notification Service logs**: “notify PROPOSAL\_SUBMITTED for proposal 1”

### Approve

```bash
curl -X POST :8081/api/proposals/1/approve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"approver":"john.doe","comments":"OK"}'
```

**Expect:** `STEP_APPROVED` then (after last step) `PROPOSAL_APPROVED`; both consumers react.

---

# 6) Code path (so you can picture it while speaking)

**Proposal Service**

* `ProposalController` → `ApprovalWorkflowService` (updates DB) → `EventPublisher` (KafkaTemplate.send)

**Audit Service**

* `@KafkaListener` method gets `ProposalEvent` → `EventRouter.switch(ev.type())` → repository.save(audit)

**Notification Service**

* `@KafkaListener` method gets `ProposalEvent` → send/print message

---

# 7) One-liner you can repeat (memory hook)

> “**HTTP in, DB change, event out; Kafka fans it out; services react independently; ordering per proposal via key; failures → DLT.**”

---

# 8) If something looks “stuck”, check these (say them too)

* Proposal Service using **`localhost:9092`** (from IDE)
* Kafka UI (container) using **`kafka:29092`**
* Topic exists: `proposal-events` (partitions ≥ 3), and groups: `audit-service`, `notification-service`
* Consumers running; **group lag** is moving; no flood in `.DLT`

If you want, I can make a **1-page cheat sheet** you can read while explaining (bullets only), or a **call-and-response audio script** where I “ask” you prompts and include the ideal 1-sentence answers.
